This project is by Matthew Rougely.

User Stories:
Upon logging in users should see the Home screen which displays cards which contain information 
about the current state of any given election. The information on the home screen cards should
include the title of poll, vote count and a button which allows voters to cast a vote.

When the user clicks on any vote button on the home screen they will be asked to login on register
if they are not currently logged in. At the "You are not logged in screen" they will be given choices.
One link will go to a registration form and the other link will go to the login form screen.

Upon logging in user will recieve feedback if login or registration is successful. After that they will
be rerouted back to the vote screen. Users will select an option via radio or drop-down input fields.

Upon submitting vote user should be given feedback of a successful completion and sent back to home screen
to view the updated vote count. The vote button at this point should be changed to reflect the fact that 
the user has already voted on that issue.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
