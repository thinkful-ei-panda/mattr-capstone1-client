User Stories:
Upon logging in users should see the Home screen which displays cards which contain information 
about the current state of any given election. The information on the home screen cards should
include the title of poll, vote count and a button which allows voters to cast a vote.

When the user clicks on any vote button on the home screen they will be asked to login on register
if they are not currently logged in. At the "You are not logged in screen" they will be given choices.
One link will go to a registration form and the other link will go to the login form screen.

Upon logging in user will recieve feedback if login or registration is successful. After that they will
be rerouted back to the vote screen. Users will select an option via radio or drop-down input fields.

Upon submitting vote user should be given feedback of a successful completion and sent back to home screen
to view the updated vote count. The vote button at this point should be changed to reflect the fact that 
the user has already voted on that issue.
